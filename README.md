Project designed to allow Food Pantry Customers to order needs on-line

This project is designed to enable Grace Care Center customers to order food and non-food items from the Grace Care Center Food Pantry.  Because this solution is based on a food pantry, inventory is unpredictable and far too labor intensive to enter:  It is not maintained.  This means that a customer might place an order for an item that is out of stock or might need something that is not is any list.  Disclaimers tell customers that they might not receive items they ordered.  Open text boxes allow customers to highlight most important needs or to communicate special needs: things that might not be listed but be in stock.

Setup involves entering categories, sub-categories and items.  Maximum quantities can be specified at both the Item and Sub-Category levels.  This will allow a customer to select, for example, 2 different cans of soup (sub-category) but any number of one kind of soup (up to the sub-category maximum).

Grace Church uses a barcode system maintained outside this project to keep track of customers and this assumption is built into this system.  All that is needed is a unique number to be entered into that barcode field.  This unique number must be maintained outside this system or the ability to add it must be added to this system.
